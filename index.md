# Hi
I'm Stern Bert. This is my attempt at a digital garden. 

I have zero coding / web development experience, so this is my experiment in trying to teach myself some basic concepts while tending to notes on what I am reading and learning.

I'm very grateful for these resources which have effectively provided the plot & soil for this little garden:
